VM can ne added as a jenkin slave or agent
we use agent where we can execute pipeline, job etc.
create a vm as a slave: pre requist is jdk should be install: sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless -y

Now we need to connect to Jenkin server to salve. as agent so whatever build we want we can run on salve machine
